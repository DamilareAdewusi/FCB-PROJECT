## DATA ANALYSIS, PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS
### 1.0	Introduction


This report deals with the detailed presentation and analysis of data collected and gathered from the targeted respondents, including interpretation of findings generated from the study. The study sampled a total of 1000 respondents in order to generate data from them. However, of the 1000 questionnaires administered, 35 were termed as incomplete and were subsequently not included in the analysis. Similarly, 7 other questionnaires were excluded from the analysis due to some noted irregularities. As a result, 958 questionnaires were termed to be complete and useful and were subsequently included in the study for analysis of data. The data generated was analyzed by the use of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software and were displayed by the use of frequency tables in order to make significant references.

### Sex	Frequency	Percent
      Male      322	33.6
      Female	603	62.9
      No response	33	3.4
      Total        958	100.0

The sex distribution as indicated in Table 5.1 above reveals of the sample of 958 respondents in the study area. Of the 958 respondents, 322 were males constituting 33.6% whilst 603 were female representing 62.9% of the population. The Table reveals that the sex distribution of the respondents yielded more responses from females when compared to their male counterpart. It is therefore clear that there are more female than male respondents as far as this study is concerned. This may be as a result of availability of more females than males as at the time the study was carried out in the study locations.
